The best-fit values of the parameters:
Amplitude: 6.28
Phase: -10.00
Offset: 11.76

The overall average temperature in Munich: ---------------- 9.25 degrees Celsius
The typical daily avaerages predicted by the model:
  Daily average for coldest time of year: ----------------- -0.76 degrees Celsius
  Daily average for hottest time of year: ----------------- 19.25 degrees Celsius

The b parameter represents the phase shift of the cosine function.
This value makes sense because this represents the amount the cosine wave has horizontally shifted from the original wave
This is also apparent from the context of our data, as a local minimum - physically meaning that the minimum temperature in Munich occurs around mid-January
