# RADIOACTIVE DECAY CHAIN - ASSIGNMENT 4 - PROB 1

# The isotope 213-Bi decays to stable 209-Bi via one of two different routes 
#	 Starting with a sample consisting of 10 000 atoms of 213Bi, 
#		simulate the decay of the atoms as in Example 10.1 by dividing time into slices of length Î´t = 1 s each 
# 		and on each step doing the following:
#	
#  		a.) For each atom of 209-Pb in turn, decide at random, with the appropriate probability, whether
#			it decays or not. (The probability can be calculated from Eq. (10.3).) Count the total number
#			that decay, subtract it from the number of 209Pb atoms, and add it to the number of 209Bi atoms.

#  		b.) Now do the same for 209Tl, except that decaying atoms are subtracted from the total for 209Tl 
#			and added to the total for 209Pb.

#  		c.) For 213Bi the situation is more complicated: when a 213Bi atom decays you have to decide at random 
#			with the appropriate probability the route by which it decays. 
#			Count the numbers that decay by each route and add and subtract accordingly.
