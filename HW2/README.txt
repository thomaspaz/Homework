SPECIAL RELATIVITY - ASSIGNMENT 2 - PROB 1

Write a program to ask the user for the value of x and the speed v as a fraction of the speed of light c,then print out the time in years that the spaceship takes to reach its destination 
(a) in the rest frame of an observer on Earth and 
(b) as perceived by a passenger on board the ship. 

Use your program to calculate the answers for a planet 10 light years away with v = 0.90c, 
v = 0.98c, v = 0.999c.

THE SEMI-EMPIRICAL MASS FORMULA - ASSIGNMENT 2 - PROB 1

In nuclear physics, the semi-empirical mass formula is a formula for calculating the approximate nuclear binding energy B of an atomic nucleus with atomic number Z and mass number A. Where, in units of millions of electron volts, the constants are a1 = 15.67, a2 = 17.23, a3 = 0.75, a4 = 93.2, 
and a5 	= 0 if A is odd
	= 12.0 if A and Z are both even  
	= -12.0 if A is even and Z is odd 

Write a program that takes as its input the values of A and Z, and prints out the binding energy for the corresponding atom.

Use your program to find the binding energy of an atom with A = 58 and Z = 28.
