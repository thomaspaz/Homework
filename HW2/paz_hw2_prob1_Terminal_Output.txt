Enter the value of x, in lightyears: 4.3
Enter the value of speed, v, as a fraction of the speed of light: 0.8

The time in years that the spaceship takes to reach its destination is:
For an observer on Earth:7.17 years
For passenger on ship:2.58 years

The time it takes a spaceship to reach a planet 10 light years away:
For an observer on Earth with v = 0.90c :22.942 years
For passenger on ship with   v = 0.90c : 4.359 years

For an observer on Earth with v = 0.98c :50.252 years
For passenger on ship with   v = 0.98c : 1.990 years

For an observer on Earth with v = 0.999c :223.663 years
For passenger on ship with   v = 0.999c :  0.447 years
